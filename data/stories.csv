THE “228 MASSACRE”,http://bit.ly/udn-228,"The “228 massacre” was a uprise that happened in 1947, when KMT fled to Taiwan from China, “the mother country.” Original residents in Taiwan were disappointed of the mother country, and consequently, there were lots of conflicts between the citizens and the police. On the night of February 27th, a 40-year-old widow was hit by an official of the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau. The crowds surrounded the officials, and one of the agents fired a gun into the crowd and accidentally killed a bystander. We visualized the reparation data provided by the The Memorial Foundation of 228, and tried to tell this story by mapping data back to history events.",,"| Worked as project manager and engineer in this project

",,prj_228_udn,"Several weeks before the anniversary of the “228 Massacre”, I told my editor that I want to do a story about the incident, and I started to look for data. We settled down with this idea after confirming with the Memorial Foundation of 228 that they could provide us with the reparation data. Our editor, Viola Tsai, lead our project team to a meeting with the foundation, deciding how the story is going to look like and what kind of data format can they provide.

Studying the calendar is always important for doing news. Also, due to the annual fierce debate online about this past incident, we believe readers would be interested in this story. "

| Built a tool to geolocate the complicated address format in Taiwan with Google Map API. 
(Addresses in the data are often noted as “Highway No.14, 70kilometers and 500 meters”, which is difficult to locate compared to latitude and longitude.) By Cutting the address into short pieces, we can geolocate an approximate location via Google geolocate api. The tool I built also provides an auxiliary function that draws a circle with a user defined radius, which helps to locate the precise address. This tool saved the reporter a lot of time.

Compared to various project abroad, our medias don’t put much strength on data in traffic stories. We believe the main difficulty is the format of data. We wanted to make a story that would give pressure to the National Police Agency to reform the way they take down the traffic accident location."

",,prj_randomstab_udn,"I have always been mad about how medias in Taiwan lead the public opinion toward the extreme of populism. I believe the terms and the images they use, are the ones to blame. The social atmosphere at that time advocates the reclamation of media integrity, but no one had ever pointed out precisely how atrocious a media was with a firm number. That was when I think we should start moving our muscles, and use data to tell the story.

Despite whether ourselves, as a media, could judge media is a problem that should be discussed, we still pursued and tried to indicate facts only based on numbers, and finished the story in two days. (We do know that number itself is still tricky, and do not guarantee absolute objectivity) This coverage not only raised a lot of discussion among readers, but also made a lot of media professionals defend their stance of producing news."
