Real Estate Management,http://bit.ly/2jh9Al9,"Property management database is a web-based real estate database that provides information and service for homebuyers, home sellers and real estate agents to exchange property information more efficiently among them. This database stores information about property details, building neighborhood, school, transportation, lists of price, etc. related to property and agents who holds the source of property. 

A homebuyer could utilize the database to look for their likely interesting home by zip code, address, price, property type (condo, house, apartment), school district and other specific condition. Real estate agents can widely publicize their listings and get contacted by potential homebuyers. Homeowners can hire the good performance agents depending on their past trading record.

| Built a tool to geolocate the complicated address format in Taiwan with Google Map API. 
(Addresses in the data are often noted as ?€?Highway No.14, 70kilometers and 500 meters?€?, which is difficult to locate compared to latitude and longitude.) By Cutting the address into short pieces, we can geolocate an approximate location via Google geolocate api. The tool I built also provides an auxiliary function that draws a circle with a user defined radius, which helps to locate the precise address. This tool saved the reporter a lot of time.

Compared to various project abroad, our medias don?€?t put much strength on data in traffic stories. We believe the main difficulty is the format of data. We wanted to make a story that would give pressure to the National Police Agency to reform the way they take down the traffic accident location."

",,prj_randomstab_udn,"I have always been mad about how medias in Taiwan lead the public opinion toward the extreme of populism. I believe the terms and the images they use, are the ones to blame. The social atmosphere at that time advocates the reclamation of media integrity, but no one had ever pointed out precisely how atrocious a media was with a firm number. That was when I think we should start moving our muscles, and use data to tell the story.

Despite whether ourselves, as a media, could judge media is a problem that should be discussed, we still pursued and tried to indicate facts only based on numbers, and finished the story in two days. (We do know that number itself is still tricky, and do not guarantee absolute objectivity) This coverage not only raised a lot of discussion among readers, but also made a lot of media professionals defend their stance of producing news."
