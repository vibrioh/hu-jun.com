Real Estate Management,http://bit.ly/2jh9Al9,"Property management database is a web-based real estate database that provides information and service for homebuyers, home sellers and real estate agents to exchange property information more efficiently among them. This database stores information about property details, building neighborhood, school, transportation, lists of price, etc. related to property and agents who holds the source of property. 

A homebuyer could utilize the database to look for their likely interesting home by zip code, address, price, property type (condo, house, apartment), school district and other specific condition. Real estate agents can widely publicize their listings and get contacted by potential homebuyers. Homeowners can hire the good performance agents depending on their past trading record.

A property has a unique property ID, address, a zip code, the number of bedroom and bathroom, the area of squire feet and a built date. One property lies in one block. The property has a list of price. The property is sold by an agent and belonged one owner. 

Sale state is the state to describe if the property is on sale right now. Sale state still shows what is the start sale date and end sale date. 

The price is composed of listing price, maintenance fee and tax deduction. Each property has an evaluated price and a last time sold price. 

Block is the district where property belongs. Each block has a unique district ID. Some block locates at water front division. The block has its commute system such as bus and subway. 

School district has its unique district number. The public school including primary, middle and high school have scores rated by education system. 

Sell agent has a unique register ID, first name, last name and telephone. 

Owner has a unique SSN number, first name and last name.

Arrhythmia Visualization,http://bit.ly/2wRjr6z,"Optical imaging with voltage-sensitive dyes is the state-of-art technique for electrophysiological mapping of the heart, which has helped to enhance our understanding of complex arrhythmias, as well as our knowledge of electrophysiological remodeling in gene-editing states. Our system uses a 100X100 pixel complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera that can achieve acquisition rates of up to 10,000 frames/s. Data from this system are saved as a series of 100X100 matrixes, each acquired at a specific time point. Each pixel represents a measure of fluorescent intensity collected from a specific location on the tissue preparation at a specific time.",,"| Explore data with R

One of the paper was published on JACC, with impact factor of 19.896, ranking 1st in cardiology filed.",prj2_arrh_vlz,Data were acquired at 1 kHz by the Cardioplex (Redshirt Imaging)  and  analyzed using a custom R script and visualized by R/OriginLab.
Large-scale Sequencing,http://bit.ly/2xgFR0O,"In this study, we performed tissue specific deletion to determine the role of Smad4 in chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation during endochondral bone formation in mouse limb. We found that loss of Smad4 within the limb resulted in absence of chondrocyte hypertrophy and ossification in humerus. To further determine how the skeletal defects arise in the mutants, we performed RNA-Seq along with ChIP-Seq analysis and found that Smad4 directly binds to Runx2 regulatory elements. Our data suggest a mechanism that Smad4 controls chondrocyte hypertrophy through regulating Runx2 expression during mouse skeletal development. The regulatory mechanism between Smad4 and Runx2 provides critical insights into the pathogenesis of chondrodysplasia.",,"| Experienced with Minerva supercomputer | UNIX/Linux system operation | Huge data retrieval and process | Lots of scientific computing packages | R ggplot2 visualization | Venn diagram | Histogram 
","This was an entirely unexpected project. As a cardiology-related lab, we were trying to find cardiac defects by conditional knocking out of SMAD4, but we did not found anything wrong in the heart. However, we found loss of bones in the limbs. So this project is now cooperating with a bone-related research lab for further discoveries.",prj3_seq,"RNA-seq analysis in the next step involves alignment.

Normalization, quantitative analysis and differential expression analysis can be done using BaySeq (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/baySeq.html), Cufflinks/Cuffdiff (http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/), DESeq(http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq.html), EdgeR(https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html), NOISeq(https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/NOISeq.html), HTSeq (http://www-huber.embl.de/HTSeq/doc/install.html) and so on. MACS, Model-based Analysis for ChIP-seq allows a more sensitive and robust prediction of peaks using dynamic Poisson distribution. It models the length of the sequenced ChIP fragments to improve the spatial resolution of predicted binding sites (http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/).
